Super Tags for Notion


## What are Super Tags?
In Notion, we create content in various places - on pages, within databases, and even in comments. Notion is a document where each block is part of a specific page. Often, we find that content (block) from one page is connected to content (block) on another. We want to link these related pieces while maintaining the existing structure.

This is where Super Tags come in handy. With Super Tags, you can attach a tag (referred to as a Super Tag) to any block in Notion. All blocks carrying this Super Tag will be compiled on a separate page. The best part? You can view and modify the content of these blocks right from this page.


## Why do we need Super Tags?
Notion has a feature called "Linked to this page" which creates backlinks at the page level. However, a Notion page is made up of many different blocks, and sometimes we might want to create a link that points directly to a specific block, not just the whole page. 

Moreover, it's not just about linking to a block - we also want the ability to view and edit the content of that block directly. This is where Super Tags come into play. They're designed to address this very issue, making it easier to manage and navigate your Notion content.


## How does it work?
1. First, make sure you've completed your setup. 

2. Once that's done, you can start tagging blocks with Super Tags. Remember, each Super Tag should begin with an underscore ("_") - that's our rule.

3. After tagging, it's time to run the script. This will compile all the blocks that share the same Super Tag onto a separate page. The name of this page will be the Super Tag you've created, which should start with an underscore and be located in your TAGS database.

4. Now, go ahead and check out the content of the Super Tag page. You'll see all the blocks that have been tagged with the same Super Tag.

5. The best part? You can edit the content of these blocks directly from this page. Feel free to rearrange the blocks, add new ones, or even delete blocks as needed.


## Who is this for?
We've taken inspiration from [Roam Research](https://roamresearch.com/) and [Tana](https://tana.inc). They've reference or backlinks feature that allows you to link to a specific block on a page. This is a great way to connect related content, while maintaining a document structure.
